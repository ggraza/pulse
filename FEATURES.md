## Features of URY Pulse


### Daily Profit and Loss:

**The heart of URY Pulse is the Daily Profit and Loss report. Here's how it works:**

- Buying Price List :
   - Users can set the buying price list to calculate the cost of goods.

- Direct Expenses :
  - This section includes expenses such as consumables (burning materials), their cost per unit, and direct fixed expenses (daily fixed expenses). You can set expense names and amounts for items that are part of your daily operational costs.
  
- Indirect Expenses :
  -  Indirect expenses consist of electricity costs per unit, expense names, and amounts that are also daily fixed expenses. Additionally, there's a section for percentage expenses, which allows you to store expense percentages based on either net sales or gross sales. You can also set depreciation in this section.


### Daily P and L Calculation:

**Once you've set up the necessary data in the Daily Profit and Loss section of URY Report Settings, the system can calculate your daily profit and loss, including the following components:**

 - Gross Sales: The total sales for the day..
 - Direct Expenses: The sum of consumables and other direct fixed expenses.
 - Cost of Goods Sold: This includes the cost of the items sold, factoring in product bundles and Bill of Materials (BOM) sub-items. 
- Gross Profit/Loss: The difference between gross sales and the cost of goods sold.
- Employee Cost: The total Employee Cost for the day, including wages, salaries, benefits, and any other related expenses. This cost is part of the Total Indirect Expense.
- Indirect Expenses: The total of indirect fixed expenses and any percentage-based expenses.
- Net Profit/Loss: The final profit or loss for the day.
 
**By inputting daily readings for consumables, electricity, and any other expenses, and then saving and submitting the document, you can generate a detailed daily profit and loss report, complete with a breakdown of the cost of goods sold. This report is an invaluable tool for restaurant owners and managers to track their financial performance on a daily basis.**
